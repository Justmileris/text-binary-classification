1. Describe text processing pipeline you have selected.

	Read data
	Add labels
	Merge data
	Sentences split to words
	Lemmatisation
	Data split to train, test
	Vectorization (CountVectorizer)
	Classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
	Neural Networks

2. Why you have selected these two classification methods?

	Naive Bayes showed highest accuracy.
	Neural networks - for fun and its possibilities.

3. Compare selected classification methods. Which one is better? Why?

	Even Naive Bayes showed highest accuracy (78.37%), Neural Nets (76.24%) has wide range for modificatons. In addition, speed should be important measurement. Implementations for these methods might be optimised, therefore higher accuracy does not mean that algorithm is better.

4. How would you compare selected classification methods if the dataset was imbalanced?

	Instead of accuracy better insights would give confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 measure score. Try many algorithms. If it is possible try augmentation.
